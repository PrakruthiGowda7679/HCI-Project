  <p>The most important thing about need finding in design thinking is that we look without knowing what we are looking for.  We trust that our ability to define the problem will emerge during the need finding process. <br><b>PROCESS:</b><br> •Bring back Stories (specific) and Artifacts (photos, drawings quotes) that communicate your Insights.<br> •After the observation phase, you will gather with your team to share findings and insights. Bias toward capturing your observations in ways that are visual, sharable & evocative.<br> •PHOTOS: Use photos to isolate points of interest & generate later discussion. Take as many as possible: 20 / hr is a good pace.<br> •SKETCHES: Sketches are a great way to interpret a scene, to create a broad representation or to call out specific details. </p>
   <p><h3>Design Methods – Needfinding:</h3><br> •QUOTES: Short quotations can be a great way to communicate the essence of a conversation with a user. Transfer to post-its.<br> •STORIES: Jot down notes as you speak with users in the field. Good stories are a tool for building empathy making meaning.<br> •RECORDINGS: audio & video Recordings of users expressing their needs are compelling. These recordings are good storytelling media in the long run. <br>•ARTIFACTS: Anything you can take with you from the location can be a good illustration of the cultural detail.</p>
